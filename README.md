# RhythmBox

Yet another spotify third-party client. Support multi-platform because built with flutter.

This project is inspired by and taken supported by [spotube](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev).
Their original app is good enough. But I just want to redesign the user interface and make it ready add to more features and more backend support.

## Highlight

Compare to original spotube. This project added more audio source e.g. netease cloud music, kugou and provide the ability to use in China Mainland.

At the same time, this project also focus on playing experience of VOCALOID songs.
We improve the search and rank algorithm to make the querying will less pick the cover version instead of original ones.

Due to the end service of jiosaavn in Asian region (maybe other regions also affected). We removed the jiosaavn audio source.
